This repository has the R code and explaination files for the activity recognition done by accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

In the repo, the CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file in the right directory.

The output of the 5th step is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded on the course project submission page directly.
